### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

I'm Matt, a full-stack software engineer and CPA professional with 5+ years of Big 4 experience in the finance and technology sectors. Born in California and grew up in Florida & California. Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Miami are all home to me.  Since graduating from college (Undergraduate - Florida State University & Masters - University of Virginia), I've worked in NYC and Miami. 

Thoroughly enjoy new challenges & experiences; especially in a team environment. As a result of my athletic and work experiences, I've always embraced the concept of we/team. Taking on challenges, helping out fellow team members, and seeing everyone succeed is a true passion of mine. All about building a strong, positive culture.  

Proficient with languages such as JavaScript, React, Ruby, Rails, SQL, HTML, and CSS. Always willing to help and go above and beyond to find the right solution. Please reach out if you have any ideas you'd love to collab on. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking to join a company and help that team achieve its goals (and have a little fun along the way too). 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on refining my skills with JavaScript & learning Python shortly  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about music, sports (especially the Miami Heat), coding, comedy, dream job/house/car, favorite concert/movie, favorite (or least favorite) dad joke, and 3 items you'd take with you to a deserted island.      
- âš¡ Fun fact: ðŸ”¥ Let's gooo Heatttt (in 6) ðŸ”¥
